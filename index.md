I’m Chris Sunny Thaliyath 🤖🚗 — an engineer passionate about robotics, ADAS, and building smart machines that move autonomously and safely in the real world.

As a Robotics and ADAS Engineer, I’m driven by a core belief: technology should uplift human life, not replace or endanger it.
My passion lies in designing intelligent autonomous systems that directly improve sectors like agriculture, warehousing, and mining—where robotics can reduce human strain, increase efficiency, and enhance safety. I specialize in robot perception, sensor fusion, and deep learning-based navigation using tools like ROS2, CARLA, and LiDAR-based SLAM.

While robotics spans many domains, I consciously choose not to contribute to military-grade autonomous weapons. We've all seen the warnings in science fiction (yes, Terminator), and I believe it's crucial to build machines that collaborate with humanity, not harm it.

I’m always open to collaborating on projects focused on sustainable automation, precision agriculture, autonomous logistics, and industrial robotics. Let’s build tech that matters.

My work bridges SLAM 📍, monocular & LiDAR odometry 🛰️, multi-sensor fusion 🔗 (EKF), and robust relocalization techniques like Bag of Words 🗂️ and Fiducial SLAM 🎯 — deploying them on ROS2 🤖, CARLA 🚘, and embedded hardware for real-time performance.

I design and implement full autonomy stacks: perception 🧠, occupancy grids 🗺️, path planning 🧩, and control loops 🔄 that power self-driving cars, warehouse robots, and advanced driver assistance systems.

I believe in creating practical, interpretable AI that scales from simulation to streets and factory floors. If you’re working on cutting-edge robotics 🤝, ADAS 🚗, or smart mobility — let’s connect and build the future together.

other than this I am also skilled at Full stack development, I have worked on a few Flask based GUI elements for the robotics projects and pipelines I have build . I am also reasonably skilled in IoS and Android app development .


Outside Robotics and ADAS , I love Physics , I love thinking about how the universe works , I love to think about how the Creator of this universe programmed the world we live in .
