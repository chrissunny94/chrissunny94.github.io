I"è<p>On December 4, 2018, they notified me.
And I was invited to attend a conference in the future.</p>

<p><img src="https://basemax.github.io/assets/image/RustProgrammingLanguage.jpg" alt="Rust Programming Language" /></p>

<p>They request me to talk about the programming language for members of the community and students , university.</p>

<p>The subject was just about the <strong>Rust Programming Language</strong>.</p>

<p>Smart people were there.</p>

<p>A university ranked about ~400 in the world. (The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2019)</p>

<p>It was also a suggestion for me to teach others some things.
And tell them about this programming language.</p>

<p>Maybe theyâ€™ll teach me something.
We do not know the future!</p>

<p>Presentation files will be posted here soon.
It will also be sent to the Rust Development Team.</p>

<p>I apologize to them for not consulting them.
I went to this conference without their coordination.</p>

<p>Hoping for further success of this technology.</p>

<p>At the conference :
I tried to ask a lot of questions</p>

<p>Because I also went there to learn.
I need to know more about people.</p>

<p>They did not know about this programming language.
And it seems to be normal in that area.
Only a few of them knew it (only name of this programming language).
But thatâ€™s not enough.</p>

<p>I do not know why Rust is as good as it can not popular yet. (Personal using)</p>

<p>If the university pay all the coordination and the cost of advertising it.
Itâ€™s likely that I will run a free workshop for this technology</p>

<p>But again I have to go there and itâ€™s not so simple.
There is little free time.</p>

<p>Someone has sent me a message and have asked if this is a competitor?
Not so.
We are mutually reinforcing.</p>

<p>I have already had talks with the development team and I am familiar with them.
I hope that we will have an opportunity again to work together.</p>

<p>Hoping for more success.</p>
