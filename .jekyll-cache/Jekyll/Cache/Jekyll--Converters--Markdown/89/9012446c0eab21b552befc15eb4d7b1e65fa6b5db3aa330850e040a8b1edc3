I"–<p>Some programming language does not require explicit type definition in the variable declaration.</p>

<p>That is to say, if an integer value is assigned to the variable $value, $value becomes an integer.
If a string value is then assigned to $value, it becomes a string.</p>

<p>a variableâ€™s type is determined by the context in which the variable is used. (automatic)</p>

<h4 id="an-example">An example:</h4>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>main()
{
	age=5+1+2+4*2
	
	ab=5*4+4*1
	ab=4+100-5*2*4.6
	
	an=4.6

	ab=5*(4-1)
	ab=5*4-1
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the code above, it is noteworthy that there is a possibility to change the value of the variable.</p>

<p>And when changing the value, its type may also change.
This is done in the code above.</p>

<p>So Compiler can be expected to display an error(not warning). Or does it automatically perform conversion work?</p>

<p>Deciding which one is the best optionâ€¦ Itâ€™s not easy.
And there are certainly discussions between the Compiler specialists.
Because each person makes a claim to a good one for reasons of the benefits.</p>
