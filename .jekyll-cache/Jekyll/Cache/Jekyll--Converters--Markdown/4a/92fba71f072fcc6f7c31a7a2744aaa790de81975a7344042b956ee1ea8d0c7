I"}<p><strong>LMPHP</strong> is a library for multi-language support in the PHP-based application backends.</p>

<p>Some things are interesting.
Some things help a lot of people.
Some small and simple things can help others.</p>

<p>Making time more valuable.</p>

<p>In 2018, when I received a message from a team in India about completing the system.
I spent a little time completing the program and fixing the problem.
I also wrote several unit-tests for the end of the collaboration.</p>

<p>After that, I thought that if this library was released based on <strong>PHP</strong> it could also help other programmers.</p>

<p>This was the reason why this small library was published as <strong>PHP</strong>-based library.</p>

<p>Based on a message that I recently received, we changed the name of this library to <strong>LMPHP</strong>. (Ver 1.1)</p>

<p>I hoping can more help to humans.</p>
