I"<p>In any case, this can be generalized to humans.</p>

<h3 id="consult-and-speak">Consult and Speak</h3>

<p>Of course, some of them are scholars and have a lot of good activities.</p>

<p>But beware.</p>

<p>Do not consult and speak with any person.</p>

<h3 id="humans">Humans</h3>

<p>Humans are different</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some of them work just for their position.</li>
  <li>And some to help and progress others around.</li>
  <li>There are also other categories that appear in both types, but prefer their positions in sensitive situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve heard this recently from a professor.
A person has managed and engineered more than 200 valuable buildings.
No cost (religious buildings are worth billions)</p>

<p>He is a famous person in the region.</p>

<p>One who can relate transitive concepts of mathematics, such as integral, and so on to the unity of God.</p>

<p>It’s so important.
While talking to a professor
Will he really want to hear and help you?</p>

<h3 id="prime-number">Prime Number</h3>

<p>I spoke with another professor last night about finding the new prime number … he did not show much interest.</p>

<p>And he did not behave well.</p>

<p>My initial question was: Have you ever made progress and helped others?</p>

<p>Because I wrote an article too.
He did even not read the text.
In a few seconds, he looked at the sheets
And said well.</p>

<p>At least some minutes he should be checked on the sheets.</p>

<p>Certainly, if he was in this case … his name was in the first names of the project.
He does not know what opportunity and suggestion he lost.</p>

<p>Of the 200 conference papers and ISI that he has published.
Has able to help the people of his area?
Has he contributed to the interest of his students?</p>

<p>No matter.
Whatever he is thinking of himself.</p>

<p>But it loses more than anything else and loses opportunities.</p>
