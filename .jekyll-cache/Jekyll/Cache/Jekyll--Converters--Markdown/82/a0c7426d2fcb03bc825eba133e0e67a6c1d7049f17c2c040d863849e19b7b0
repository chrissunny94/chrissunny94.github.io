I"<p><strong>JPOPHP</strong> (JSON Parser Object PHP) is a library for parsing the data in JSON format.</p>

<p>Some things are interesting.
Some things help a lot of people.</p>

<p>Making time more valuable.</p>

<p>I spent a little time completing the program and fixing the problem.
I also wrote several unit-tests for the end of the collaboration.</p>

<p>After that, I thought that if this library was released based on <strong>PHP</strong> it could also help other programmers.</p>

<p>This was the reason why this small library was published as <strong>PHP</strong>-based library.</p>

<p>Based on a message that I recently received, we changed the name of this library to <strong>JPOPHP</strong>.</p>

<p>I hoping can more help to humans.</p>
