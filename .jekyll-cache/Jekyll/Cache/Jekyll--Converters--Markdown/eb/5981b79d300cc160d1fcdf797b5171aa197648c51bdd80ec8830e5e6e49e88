I"ç<p>But this decision is not so simple.
If I go â€¦ What are the current projects?</p>

<p>This offer has been made by Google.</p>

<h2 id="does-development-of-et-language-stop">Does development of ET language stop?</h2>

<p>I must say that: the project that has been under construction for more than 10 years is not easily abandoned.
And do not worry because we do not destroy the project.</p>

<p>If my decision is final and there is no problem, I will go to Google â€¦ and there is likely to be working on developing the next generation Go language.</p>

<p>But this does not make projects abandon.</p>

<h2 id="can-a-person-or-group-work-for-a-rival-project">Can a person or group work for a rival project?</h2>

<p>We must say that Google is not our rival.</p>

<p>Persons need Google.
Google needs persons.</p>

<p>We can progress with each otherâ€™s help.</p>

<h2 id="goal">Goal?</h2>
<p>We not should think then why to help our friends.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a fact.
All persons need others.</p>

<p>Do not forget that we not should trying to be better of friends.
We should try to make a better place for all.
myself, friends, other persons.</p>

<p>The main goal is to help the community and progress.</p>

<p>We should try to we be more usefull for all.</p>

<h2 id="final">Final</h2>

<p>It seems to be doing better.</p>

<p>Work that is more effective.</p>

<p>Choosing this is a hard way and requires a lot of thought and advice.</p>

<p>Perhaps it could be more effective and useful in another way.</p>
